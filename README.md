# Movie recommendations.
## Introduction:
For this project, we will use the "small" dataset from [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/). This dataset includes four main files:

- **movies.csv**: Contains information about each movie, including its ID, title, and genres.  
- **ratings.csv**: Records user ratings, with fields for user ID, movie ID, rating, and timestamp.  
- **tags.csv**: Aggregates user-generated keywords associated with movies.  
- **links.csv**: Provides mappings between MovieLens IDs and external databases such as IMDb and TMDB.

Since good recommendations play an important role in client satisfaction we will make of Our objective to develop a recommendation system that can automatically suggest the top 5 movies to a given user. These recommendations will be based on the user's past ratings and those of similar users.
